BRCA1 is a tumor suppressor gene that plays a critical role in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks through homologous recombination repair. Mutations in BRCA1 impair this process, leading to genomic instability.

Breast cancer is often associated with inherited mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. Individuals carrying these mutations have a significantly increased risk of developing breast and ovarian cancers.

PARP inhibitors, such as Olaparib, are targeted cancer therapies that exploit synthetic lethality. In BRCA1-deficient cells, inhibition of PARP leads to the accumulation of DNA damage, resulting in cell death.

Homologous recombination is an error-free DNA repair pathway. It involves proteins such as BRCA1, BRCA2, and RAD51 that are essential for the proper repair of double-strand DNA breaks.

Synthetic lethality occurs when two genetic deficiencies lead to cell death, while each alone is non-lethal. This concept is used in cancer therapy to selectively kill tumor cells.

Olaparib is approved for treatment of advanced ovarian and breast cancers associated with BRCA1/2 mutations. It works by inhibiting the PARP enzyme involved in base excision repair.

RAD51 is recruited by BRCA2 during homologous recombination repair and plays a key role in strand invasion and exchange. A disruption in BRCA2 impairs RAD51 localization and repair efficiency.

Loss of BRCA function not only increases cancer risk but also creates vulnerabilities that can be exploited with specific therapies targeting DNA repair pathways.

The ATM gene is another DNA damage response gene that works upstream of BRCA1. Mutations in ATM can also sensitize tumors to DNA-damaging agents.

Checkpoint inhibitors are a class of immunotherapies that act by unleashing the immune system against tumors, though their efficacy in BRCA-mutated tumors is still under investigation.
